Description:
Arduino example program for interfacing to hugp002a LCD.  This is a surplus LCD that I found long ago.  It appears to be a surplus LCD from a very old cell phone.  This example serves to demonstrate how to control the LCD icons using the standard arduino character LCD library.  I also wrote a datasheet with all of the information I could gather (or reverse engineer) on this LCD.
